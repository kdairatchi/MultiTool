## Overview

This tool provides a convenient way to scan network targets using the popular `naabu` network scanning tool with easy-to-read, color-enhanced terminal output. The script is written in Python and integrates `colorama` for colorful and formatted console output.

## Features

- Displays a banner in color when the tool starts.
- Runs `naabu` to perform a port scan on a given target.
- Provides formatted, colorized output for easy identification of scan results.
- Error handling to catch issues during execution.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing this tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `naabu` network scanning tool ([Naabu GitHub Repository](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu))

To install `naabu`:
```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu/v2/cmd/naabu@latest
```
You also need to add `naabu` to your system's PATH variable so it can be run from the command line.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-tool-network-scanner.git
    cd multi-tool-network-scanner
    ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

    This project requires a few Python libraries, like `colorama`. You can install the required dependencies using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Ensure Naabu is Installed**

    Make sure that `naabu` is installed and added to your PATH.

4. **Run the Tool**

    You are now ready to run the network scanner tool. See the [Usage](#usage) section for details.

## Usage

To scan a target with the tool, use the following command:

```bash
python multi_tool.py <target>
```

Where `<target>` is the IP address or domain name of the target you want to scan.

### Running the Tool

To scan a target, simply provide the target as a command-line argument:

```bash
python multi_tool.py 192.168.1.1
```

This will run the scan using `naabu` and output the results to the terminal with colored formatting.

### Example

```bash
$ python multi_tool.py 192.168.1.1
```

Expected Output:

```plaintext
    __  __       _ _   _ _____           _             _         
    |  \/  |     (_) | | |_   _|         | |           | |        
    | \  / | __ _ _| |_| |_| |_ __ _  ___| | _____ _ __| |_ _   _ 
    | |\/| |/ _` | | __| __|  _/ _` |/ __| |/ / _ \ '__| __| | | |
    | |  | | (_| | | |_| |_| || (_| | (__|   <  __/ |  | |_| |_| |
    |_|  |_|\__,_|_|\__|\__\_| \__,_|\___|_|\_\___|_|   \__|\__, |
                                                            __/ |
                                                           |___/ 
                     by kdairatchi

Scanning target: 192.168.1.1

Naabu Output:
80/tcp    open  http
443/tcp   open  https
22/tcp    open  ssh
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

1. **Naabu Not Installed or Not in Path**  
   - **Error Message**: `An error occurred while running naabu: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'naabu'`
   - **Cause**: `naabu` is not installed or not added to your system's PATH.
   - **Fix**: Install `naabu` using the [official instructions](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu#installation) and ensure it is in your PATH.

2. **Naabu Permissions Issue**  
   - **Error Message**: `Error: permission denied`
   - **Cause**: Running `naabu` might require elevated privileges.
   - **Fix**: Try running the script with `sudo` or as an administrator:
     ```bash
     sudo python multi_tool.py <target>
     ```

3. **Missing Python Modules**  
   - **Error Message**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colorama'`
   - **Cause**: Required Python modules not installed.
   - **Fix**: Install dependencies using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Fixes

- **Ensure `naabu` is installed correctly**: Check that `naabu` can be run from the command line by typing `naabu -version`. If the command is not found, make sure that the Go installation is properly set up and `naabu` is in your system's PATH.
  
- **Check for Elevated Privileges**: For certain network operations, you may need administrator or root privileges. Try running the script with `sudo` or as an administrator.
